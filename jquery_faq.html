<h3 id="park1">Joshua Tree</h3>
<ul id="4facts-park1" class="facts">
    <li>While pets are allowed in the park, their activities are restricted. They must be on a leash at all times and cannot be more than 100 feet from a road, picnic area, or campground; they are prohibited from trails, and they must never be left unattended—not even in a vehicle.</li>
    <li>The extent and timing of wildflower blooms vary from year to year depending upon rains at the right time, warm-enough temperatures to produce flower stalks but not so warm as to dry out the plants, the elevation at which the plant is growing, and the type of plant.</li>
    <li>According to legend, Mormon pioneers considered the limbs of the Joshua trees to resemble the upstretched arms of Joshua, leading them to the promised land. However, this tale is not substantiated in record and might be more myth than history. Joshua trees have gone by many names, including hunuvat chiy’a, huêlye, dirk pear tree, yucca tree, and dragon yucca. It is currently unknown how the name, Joshua tree, stuck while the others did not.</li>
    <li>Joshua Tree provides habitat for 813 higher plant species, 46 reptile species, 57 mammal species, and over 250 bird species.</li>
