<h3 id="park1">Joshua Tree</h3>
<ul id="4facts-park1" class="facts">
    <li>While pets are allowed in the park, their activities are restricted. They must be on a leash at all times and cannot be more than 100 feet from a road, picnic area, or campground; they are prohibited from trails, and they must never be left unattended—not even in a vehicle.</li>
    <li>The extent and timing of wildflower blooms vary from year to year depending upon rains at the right time, warm-enough temperatures to produce flower stalks but not so warm as to dry out the plants, the elevation at which the plant is growing, and the type of plant.</li>
    <li>According to legend, Mormon pioneers considered the limbs of the Joshua trees to resemble the upstretched arms of Joshua, leading them to the promised land. However, this tale is not substantiated in record and might be more myth than history. Joshua trees have gone by many names, including hunuvat chiy’a, huêlye, dirk pear tree, yucca tree, and dragon yucca. It is currently unknown how the name, Joshua tree, stuck while the others did not.</li>
    <li>Joshua Tree provides habitat for 813 higher plant species, 46 reptile species, 57 mammal species, and over 250 bird species.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="park2">Dry Tortugas</h3>
<ul id="4facts-park2" class="facts">
    <li>The entrance fee for Dry Tortugas National Park is $15.00 per person and is good for 7 consecutive days.</li>
    <li>It is important to know that Dry Tortugas National Park has a carrying capacity of 68 people to camp at Garden Key. </li>
    <li>The location of the Tortugas along one the world’s busiest shipping lanes was its greatest military asset. Though passing ships could easily avoid the largest of Fort Jefferson’s guns, they could not avoid the warships that used its harbor.</li>
    <li>Poised to protect this valuable harbor was one of the largest forts ever built. Nearly thirty years in the making (1846-1875), Fort Jefferson was never finished nor fully armed. Yet it was a vital link in a chain of coastal forts that stretched from Maine to California. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="park3">Everglades</h3>
<ul id="4facts-park3" class="facts">
    <li>Everglades National Park covers 1.5 million acres of South Florida and spans 3 counties: Monroe, Miami-Dade, and Collier.</li>
    <li>There are 3 ways to access the park. The main entrance located on State Road 9336 in Homestead, which connects visitors to the Royal Palm area and the Flamingo area of Everglades National Park. The Shark Valley entrance is located on U.S. 41 Tamiami Trail in Miami and the Gulf Coast entrance is located on Oyster Bar Lane in Everglades City.</li>
    <li>The notion of draining the vast wetland persisted into the 20th century. Expanded dredging efforts between 1905 and 1910 transformed large tracts from wetland to agricultural land. This abundance of "new" land stimulated the first of several south Florida land booms.</li>
    <li>The year 1948 marked an even greater change when Congress authorized the Central and South Florida Project. This involved the construction of an elaborate system of roads, canals, levees, and water-control structures stretching throughout South Florida. </li>
</ul>
